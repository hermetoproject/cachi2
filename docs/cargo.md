# Cargo

<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/>

## Prerequisites

To use Hermeto with Cargo locally, ensure you have Cargo binary installed on your
system. Then, ensure that the **Cargo.toml** and **Cargo.lock** are in your
project directory.

## Usage

Run the following commands in your terminal to prefetch your project's
dependencies specified in the **Cargo.lock**. It must be synchronized with the **Cargo.toml**
file. Otherwise, the command will fail.

```bash
cd path-to-your-rust-project
hermeto fetch-deps cargo
```

The default output directory is `hermeto-output`. You can change it by passing
the `--output-dir` option for the `fetch-deps` command. See the help message
for more information.

After prefetching the dependencies, you can use the `hermeto inject-files` command to update the
`.cargo/config.toml` file in your project directory. If it does not exist, it will be created. The
file will contain instructions for Cargo to use the prefetched dependencies when compiling a
project.

Use the `--for-output-dir` option to specify the location where you want to mount the
`hermeto-output` in your container build environment. See the next section.

**Do not forget to copy `.cargo/config.toml` when building your container image.**

```bash
hermeto inject-files --for-output-dir /tmp/hermeto-output hermeto-output
```

_There are no environment variables that need to be set for the build phase._

## Hermetic build

After using the `fetch-deps`, and `inject-files` commands to set up the directory,
you can build your project hermetically. Here is an example of a Dockerfile with
basic instructions to build a Rust project:

```Dockerfile
FROM docker.io/library/rust:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock .cargo .

RUN cargo build --release
```

Do not forget to mount the `hermeto-output` directory to the container build environment.

```bash
podman build . \
  --volume "$(realpath ./hermeto-output)":/tmp/hermeto-output:Z \
  --network none \
  --tag my-rust-app
```
